Non-partionable graphs: 
-complete graphs
-stars

complete bipartite graphs with at least one of the vertex set in odd size.
Partitionable: 
-cycles of length at least 4
-trees which are not stars (check if connected, then count # edges)
-disconnected graphs.

Program: 
-check if graph is partitionable
-if graph is partitionable, find and return partition


Things we should implement: given a partition (A, B). Verify if it is satisfactory or not.
